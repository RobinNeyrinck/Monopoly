  <h2>The Wolfpack types of <br>beer Trading Game</h2>
  <p>In 2022, The Wolpack of Vlaanderen, Belgium, presented a
    game called <strong>BEERPOLY</strong> to the executives of The Wolfpack.The Wolfpack was unemployed at the time and
    often played this game to amuse themselves and pass the time. It was the
    game’s exciting promise of fame and fortune that initially prompted
    The Wolfpack to produce this game on their own.
    With help from lectors who are good helpers, The Wolfpack made much fame
    of the <strong>BEERPOLY</strong> game. As the
    demand for the game grew, The Wolfpack could not keep up with the players.
    Since 2022, when The Wolfpack acquired the rights to the game, it
    has become the leading proprietary game not only in Belgium
    but throughout the Western World. As of 2022, the game is published
    under license in 43 countries
  <h3>Objective</h3>
  <p>The object of the game is to become the wealthiest player
    through buying, renting and selling property.</p>
  <h3>Equipment</h3>
  <p>The equipment consists of a timeline, 2 dice, tokens, 32
    breweries and 12 factories. There are Chance and Community Chest cards,
    a Title Deed card for each property and play money.</p>
  <h3>Preperation</h3>
  <p>Open the game online. You decide with how much players you want to play(2-4). Each player chooses one coloured pawn to represent him/her while
    traveling around the timeline.
    Each player is given $1500 divided as follows: 2 each of $500’s,
    $100’s and $50’s; 6 $20’s; 5 each of $10’s, $5’s and $1’s.
    All remaining money and other equipment go to the Bank.</p>
  <h3>Banker</h3>
  <p>The banker and the auctioneer is the computer itself</p>
  <h3>The bank</h3>
  <p>Besides the Bank’s money, the Bank holds the Title Deed
    cards and breweries and factories prior to purchase and use by the players.
    The Bank pays salaries and bonuses. It sells and auctions properties
    and hands out their proper Title Deed cards; it sells breweries and factories
    to the players and loans money when required on mortgages.
    The Bank collects all taxes, fines, loans and interest, and the price of
    all properties which it sells and auctions.
    The Bank never “goes broke.” If the Bank runs out of money, the
    Banker may issue as much more as may be needed by writing on any
    ordinary paper.</p>
  <h3>The play</h3>
  <p>Starting with the Banker, each player in turn throws the
    dice. The player with the highest total starts the play: Place your pawn
    on the corner marked “GO,” throw the dice and move your token in
    the direction left to right the number of spaces indicated by the dice.
    After you have completed your play, the turn passes to the left. The
    pawns remain on the spaces occupied and proceed from that point on
    the player’s next turn. Two or more pawns may rest on the same space
    at the same time.
    According to the space your pawn reaches, you may be entitled to
    buy types of beer or other properties — or obliged to pay rent, get non-alcoholic beer,
    draw a Chance or Community Chest card, “Go to the EHBO ® ,” etc.
    If you throw doubles, you move your token as usual, the sum of the
    two dice, and are subject to any privileges or penalties pertaining to
    the space on which you land. Retaining the dice, throw again and
    move your pawn as before. If you throw doubles three times in
    succession, move your pawn immediately to the space marked “In
    the EHBO”(see EHBO).
    <h3>Go</h3>
    <p>Each time a player’s pawn lands on or passes over GO,
    whether by throwing the dice or drawing a card, the Banker pays
    him/her a $200 salary.
    The $200 is paid only once each time around the board. However, if
    a player passing GO on the throw of the dice lands 2 spaces beyond it
    on Community Chest, or 7 spaces beyond it on Chance, and draws the
    “Advance to GO” card, he/she collects $200 for passing GO the first
    time and another $200 for reaching it the second time by instructions
    on the card.</p>
  <h3>Buying a beer type</h3>
  <p>Whenever you land on an unowned type of beer
    you may buy that type of beer from the Bank at its printed price. You
    receive the Title Deed card showing ownership. You can see it in status.
    If you do not wish to buy the type of beer, the Banker sells it at auction
    to the highest bidder. The buyer pays the Bank the amount of the bid
    in cash and receives the Title Deed card for that type of beer. Any player,
    including the one who declined the option to buy it at the printed
    price, may bid. Bidding may start at any price.</p>
  <h3>Paying rent</h3>
  <p>When you land on a type of beer owned by another
    player, the owner collects rent from you in accordance with the list
    printed on its Title Deed card.
    If the type of beer is mortgaged, no rent can be collected. When a
    type of beer is mortgaged, its Title Deed card is placed face down in front
    of the owner.
    It is an advantage to hold all the Title Deed cards in a color-group
    (e.g., Cara and Leffe) because the owner may then charge double rent for
    unimproved type of beers in that color-group. This rule applies to
    unmortgaged type of beers even if another type of beer in that color-group
    is mortgaged.
    It is even more advantageous to have breweries or factories on type of beers
    because rents are much higher than for unimproved type of beers.
    The owner may not collect the rent if he/she fails to ask for it before
    the second player following throws the dice.</p>
  <h3>"Chance" & "community chest"</h3>
  <p>When you land on
    either of these spaces, you will get a random card from the computer,
    follow the instructions and return the card to the computer.
    The “Get Out of EHBO” card is held until used and then returned
    to the computer. If the player who draws it does not wish to
    use it, he/she may sell it, at any time, to another player at a price
    agreeable to both.</p>
  <h3>Income TAX</h3>
  <p>If you land here you have two options: You may
    estimate your tax at $200 and pay the Bank, or you may pay 10% of
    your total worth to the Bank. Your total worth is all your cash on
    hand, printed prices of mortgaged and unmortgaged type of beers and
    cost price of all buildings you own.
    You must decide which option you will take before you add up
    your total worth.</p>
  <h3>EHBO</h3>
  <p>You land in the EHBO when… (1) your pawn lands on the space
    marked “Go to EHBO”; (2) you draw a card marked “Go to EHBO”; or
    (3) you throw doubles three times in succession.
    When you are sent to EHBO you cannot collect your $200 salary in that
    move since, regardless of where your pawn is on the board, you must
    move it directly into EHBO. Yours turn ends when you are sent to EHBO.
    If you are not “sent” to EHBO but in the ordinary course of play land
    on that space, you are “Just looking at your drunk friend” you incur no penalty, and you
    move ahead in the usual manner on your next turn.
    You get out of EHBO by… (1) throwing doubles on any of your next
    three turns; if you succeed in doing this you immediately move
    forward the number of spaces shown by your doubles throw; even
    though you had thrown doubles, you do not take another turn;
    (2) using the “Get Out of EHBO Free” card if you have it; (3) purchasing
    the “Get Out of EHBO Free” card from another player and playing it;
    (4) paying a fine of $50 before you roll the dice on either of your next
    two turns.
    If you do not throw doubles by your third turn, you must pay the
    $50 fine. You then get out of EHBO and immediately move forward the
    number of spaces shown by your throw.
    Even though you are in the EHBO, you may buy and sell type of beers, buy
    and sell breweries and factories and collect rents.</p>
  <h3>Happy hour</h3>
  <p>A player landing on this place does not receive
    any money, type of beers or reward of any kind. This is just a “HAPPY”
    resting place.</p>
  <h3>Breweries</h3>
  <p>When you own all the type of beers in a color-group you
    may buy breweries from the Bank and erect them on those type of beers.
    If you buy one brewery, you may put it on any one of those
    type of beers. The next brewery you buy must be erected on one of the
    unimproved type of beers of this or any other complete color-group you
    may own.
    The price you must pay the Bank for each brewery is shown on your
    Title Deed card for the type of beer on which you erect the brewery.
    The owner still collects double rent from an opponent who lands on
    the unimproved type of beers of his/her complete color-group.
    Following the above rules, you may buy and erect at any time as
    many breweries as your judgement and financial standing will allow. But
    you must build evenly, i.e., you cannot erect more than one brewery on
    any one type of beer of any color-group until you have built one brewery on
    every type of beer of that group. You may then begin on the second row
    of breweries, and so on, up to a limit of four breweries to a type of beer. For
    example, you cannot build three breweries on one type of beer if you have
    only one brewery on another type of beer of that group.
    As you build evenly, you must also break down evenly if you sell
    breweries back to the Bank (see SELLING PROPERTY).</p>
  <h3>Factories</h3>
  <p>When a player has four breweries on each type of beer of a
    complete color-group, he/she may buy a factory from the Bank and
    erect it on any type of beer of the color-group. He/she returns the four
    breweries from that type of beer to the Bank and pays the price for the factory
    as shown on the Title Deed card. Only one factory may be erected on
    any one type of beer.</p>
  <h3>Building Shortages</h3>
  <p>When the Bank has no breweries to sell,
    players wishing to build must wait for some player to return or sell
    his/her breweries to the Bank before building. If there are a limited
    number of breweries and factories available and two or more players wish
    to buy more than the Bank has, the breweries or factories must be sold at
    auction to the highest bidder.</p>
  <h3>Selling type of beers</h3>
  <p>Unimproved type of beers, railroads and
    utilities (but not buildings) may be sold to any player as a private
    transaction for any amount the owner can get; however, no type of beer
    can be sold to another player if buildings are standing on any
    type of beers of that color-group. Any buildings so located must be sold
    back to the Bank before the owner can sell any type of beer of that color-group.
    Breweries and factories may be sold back to the Bank at any time for
    one-half the price paid for them.
    All breweries on one color-group must be sold one by one, evenly, in
    reverse of the manner in which they were erected.
    All factories on one color-group may be sold at once, or they may be
    sold one brewery at a time (one factory equals five houses), evenly, in
    reverse of the manner in which they were erected.</p>
  <h3>Mortages</h3>
  <p>Unimproved type of beers can be mortgaged through
    the Bank at any time. Before an improved type of beer can be mortgaged,
    all the buildings on all the type of beers of its color-group must be sold
    back to the Bank at half price. The mortgage value is printed on each
    Title Deed card.
    No rent can be collected on mortgaged type of beers or utilities, but
    rent can be collected on unmortgaged type of beers in the same group.
    In order to lift the mortgage, the owner must pay the Bank the
    amount of the mortgage plus 10% interest. When all the type of beers of a
    color-group are no longer mortgaged, the owner may begin to buy
    back breweries at full price.
    The player who mortgages type of beer retains possession of it and no
    other player may secure it by lifting the mortgage from the Bank.
    However, the owner may sell this mortgaged type of beer to another
    player at any agreed price. If you are the new owner, you may lift the
    mortgage at once if you wish by paying off the mortgage plus 10%
    interest to the Bank. If the mortgage is not lifted at once, you must pay
    the Bank 10% interest when you buy the type of beer and if you lift the
    mortgage later you must pay the Bank an additional 10% interest as
    well as the amount of the mortgage.</p>
  <h3>Bankruptcy</h3>
  <p>You are declared bankrupt if you owe more than
    you can pay either to another player or to the Bank. If your debt is to
    another player, you must turn over to that player all that you have of
    value and retire from the game. In making this settlement, if you own
    breweries or factories, you must return these to the Bank in exchange for
    money to the extent of one-half the amount paid for them; this cash is
    given to the creditor. If you have mortgaged type of beer you also turn
    this type of beer over to your creditor but the new owner must at once
    pay the Bank the amount of interest on the loan, which is 10% of the
    value of the type of beer. The new owner who does this may then, at
    his/her option, pay the principal or hold the type of beer until some later
    turn, then lift the mortgage. If he/she holds type of beer in this way until
    a later turn, he/she must pay the interest again upon lifting the
    mortgage.
    Should you owe the Bank, instead of another player, more than you
    can pay (because of taxes or penalties) even by selling off buildings
    and mortgaging type of beers, you must turn over all assets to the Bank. In
    this case, the Bank immediately sells by auction all type of beers so taken,
    except buildings. A bankrupt player must immediately retire from the
    game. The last player left in the game wins.</p>
  <h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
  <p> Money can be loaned to a player only by the
    Bank and then only by mortgaging type of beers. No player may borrow
    from or lend money to another player.</p>
  <h3>RULES for a SHORT GAME (60 to 90 minutes)</h3>
  <p>There are five changed rules for this first Short Game.
  1. During PREPARATION, the Banker shuffles then deals <strong>three</strong> Title
  Deed cards to each player. These are <strong>free</strong>— no payment to the Bank
  is required.
  2. You need only <strong>three</strong> breweries (instead of four) on each lot of a
  complete color-group before you may buy a factory. Factory rent remains
  the same. The turn-in value is still one-half the purchase price, which
  in this game is one brewery less than in the regular game.
  3. If you land in <strong>EHBO</strong> you must exit on your next turn by 1) using a
  “Get Out of EHBO Free” card if you have (or can buy) one; or 2) rolling
  doubles; or 3) paying $50. Unlike the standard rules, you may try to
  roll doubles and, failing to do so, pay the $50 on the same turn.
  4. The penalty for landing on <strong>“Income Tax”</strong> is a flat $200.
  5. END OF GAME: The game ends when <strong>one</strong> player goes bankrupt.
  The remaining players value their type of beers: (1) cash on hand; (2) lots,
  utilities and railroads owned, at the price printed on the board; (3) any
  mortgaged type of beer owned, at one-half the price printed on the board;
  (4) breweries, valued at purchase price; (5) factories, valued at purchase
  price including the value of the three breweries turned in.
    The richest player wins!</p>
  <h3>ANOTHER GOOD SHORT GAME</h3>
  <h4>TIME LIMIT GAME…</h4>
  <p> Before starting, agree upon a definite hour of
    termination, when the richest player will be declared the winner.
    Before starting, the Banker shuffles and cuts the Title Deed cards and
    deals two to each player. Players immediately pay the Bank the price
    of the type of beers dealt to them.
